  description: |
    The test verifies HDMI output functionality by analyzing dmesg logs
    for specific vc4-related messages. It checks for errors such as missing
    CRTC or sizes and confirms correct operation by detecting the frame buffer
    device. Additionally, it checks if the desktop environment is running
    when the system image is the 'default' one.

    The test script should run on the DUT to validate HDMI status directly.
