    Test RS485 with low baud rate.

    If RS485 is used with a low baud rate of something like 1200 baud it can
    happen that it interferes with the PiBridge. piControl will throw lots of
    errors in the kernel log then.

    The only prerequisite is that the device has a proper config.rsc active.
