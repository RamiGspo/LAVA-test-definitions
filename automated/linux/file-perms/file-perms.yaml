  description: |
    Test that some files have the correct permissions set.

    The RevPi images are built with debos. Some files included in the images
    are copied by the "overlay" action, which sets the permissions of the files
    inside the image to the same permissions that the original files have. To
    avoid mistakes in the image building process, the file permissions will be
    checked to ensure a secure system.
